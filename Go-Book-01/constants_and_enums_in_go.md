In Go (Golang), **constants** are declared using the `const` keyword and are evaluated at **compile time**, not runtime. They can hold values of **boolean, numeric, string, or rune** types.

Your code demonstrates several important Go features related to constants, especially **`iota`**, which is a powerful tool for generating sequences of constants—commonly used for enums or bit flags.

Let’s break down the key parts of your code:

---

### 1. **Basic Constants**
```go
const PI = 3.1415926

const (
	C1 = "C1C1C1"
	C2 = "C2C2C2"
	C3 = "C3C3C3"
)
```
- `PI` is a **typed constant** (implicitly `float64`).
- The block `const (...)` groups related constants.
- These are **string constants**, useful for configuration or symbolic names.

---

### 2. **Local Constant in Function**
```go
func main() {
	const s1 = 123
	var v1 float32 = s1 * 12
	fmt.Println(v1)
}
```
- `s1` is a **local constant** inside `main()`.
- Even though `s1` is untyped, Go allows it to be used in arithmetic with `float32` because constants are **untyped by default** and can be converted as needed at compile time.

> ✅ This works because `123 * 12 = 1476` is computed at compile time, then converted to `float32`.

---

### 3. **Using `iota` for Enum-like Constants**
```go
const (
	Zero Digit = iota
	One
	Two
	Three
	Four
)
```

#### What is `iota`?
- `iota` is a **predeclared identifier** in Go that starts at `0` and **increments by 1** for each constant in a `const` block.
- It **resets to 0** in each new `const` block.

#### How it works here:
- `iota` starts at 0.
- Each line gets the next value:

| Constant | Value (`iota`) | Type      |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Zero   | 0              | `Digit`  |
| One    | 1              | `Digit`  |
| Two    | 2              | `Digit`  |
| Three  | 3              | `Digit`  |
| Four   | 4              | `Digit`  |

So:
```go
fmt.Println(One)  // prints: 1
fmt.Println(Two)  // prints: 2
```

This is Go’s way of creating **enumerated constants** (like enums in other languages).

> 🔸 `Digit` is a **type alias** for `int`, so these constants are of type `Digit`, not plain `int`. This adds type safety.

---

### 4. **Using `iota` with Bit Shifting (Power-of-Two Constants)**
```go
const (
	p2_0 Power2 = 1 << iota
	_
	p2_2
	_
	p2_4
	_
	p2_6
)
```

This is a **clever idiom** for defining powers of two (useful for **bit flags**).

#### Step-by-step:
- `iota` starts at 0.
- `1 << iota` means **bitwise left shift**: `1 << n` = \(2^n\)

| Line | `iota` | Expression     | Value       |
|------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| 1    | 0      | `1 << 0`       | 1 (2⁰)      |
| 2    | 1      | `_` (ignored)  | —           |
| 3    | 2      | `1 << 2`       | 4 (2²)      |
| 4    | 3      | `_`            | —           |
| 5    | 4      | `1 << 4`       | 16 (2⁴)     |
| 6    | 5      | `_`            | —           |
| 7    | 6      | `1 << 6`       | 64 (2⁶)     |

The **blank identifier `_`** skips those constants (they’re not usable, but `iota` still increments).

So output:
```go
fmt.Println("2^0:", p2_0) // 1
fmt.Println("2^2:", p2_2) // 4
fmt.Println("2^4:", p2_4) // 16
fmt.Println("2^6:", p2_6) // 64
```

> 💡 This pattern is commonly used for **flag masks**:
> ```go
> const (
>   Read  = 1 << iota // 1
>   Write               // 2
>   Execute             // 4
> )
> ```

### Summary: Key Concepts

| Concept        | Purpose |
|---------------|--------|
| `const`       | Compile-time immutable values |
| `iota`        | Auto-incrementing counter in `const` blocks |
| Typed constants (`Digit`, `Power2`) | Adds type safety; prevents accidental mixing with other types |
| `1 << iota`   | Generates powers of two for bit flags |
| `_` in const block | Skips a value but lets `iota` increment |

This is idiomatic Go for defining **enumerations**, **configuration constants**, and **bitwise flags**—all evaluated at compile time for efficiency and safety.
